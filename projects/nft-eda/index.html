							<h1>nft market sector analysis</h1>
								<section>
									<h2>background</h2>
									<p>One sector of crypto that fascinates me technologically despite continued market underperformance has been NFTs. While the sector had a boom in 2021, it has yet to make a full recovery from its all time highs, instead making a steady bleed in both unique holder count and total volume in USD over the past three years.</p>

												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>While this is the case, there is a potential macro trend shift favorable for bulls in the data following the massive drop in both monthly volume and unique holder count in mid-2024 (capitulation) and the consolidation period in the months following. Notably, this consolidation happens prior to Donald Trump's election in November 2024 and the trend shift began immediately following his election. Will Donald Trump's presidency breathe some signs of life for the sector again?</p>
									<h2>initial pulse readings</h2>

										</div>
									<p>From a technical standpoint, monthly USD volume for NFT marketplaces is forming a falling wedge pattern that may potentially break out to the upside with an inverse head and shoulders pattern.</p>
									<p>From a fundamental standpoint, Donald Trump's presidency would be the catalyst to the upside, and all signs do seem to point to further crypto adoption from both the US (through the upcoming US Sovereign Wealth Fund and the Trump family's World Liberty Financial) and globally (through banks and country treasury funds). A rising tide lifts all boats, and I believe we are truly in the crypto "supercycle" given the current political and economic climate.</p>
									<h2>crypto cycles and the narrative</h2>
									<p>In 2021, the narrative went:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>TOTAL3 (Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC and ETH) breaks ATH cleanly in February 2021 and creates a new ATH in May 2021, leading to a sudden wealth influx by the winners</li>
										<li>Winners store / flex newfound wealth through NFTs (generative art, pfps), leading to a sector-wide boom and ATH in January 2022, 7 months after TOTAL3 ATH</li>
									</ol>
									<p> </p>
									<p>TOTAL3 peaked in May 2021 at roughly 1T. TOTAL3 is hovering around 900B today, simply waiting for a catalyst to send itself cleanly into new price territories.</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">
												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart3.png" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
										<p>We can see this to the same effect with monthly USD volume for DEX exchanges, with an ATH in May 2021 of roughly 290B and standing right below ATHs today at about 260B. To note, last cycle, ATH monthly volume for NFT marketplaces to DEX exchanges was offset by roughly 7 months, with NFTs peaking 7 months after DEX in January 2022.</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">
												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart5.png" alt="" />
												</span>
												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart6.png" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>With understanding of the narrative (people gain wealth, then store / flex it), it would be logical to assume that once TOTAL3 and monthly USD DEX volume breaks to the upside cleanly, thus sending itself into new price territories and creating new all time highs, then NFTs would likely follow suit and we would see sector relevancy in the months following.</p>
									<h2>trump's presidency as a major catalyst</h2>
										<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">
												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart7.png" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>Weekly DEX volume has been steadily increasing since September 2024. This is following the drop in May 2024 and consolidation period in the months after.</p>
									<p>If DEX weekly volume continues at this upwards pace, then DEX monthly volume will cleanly break ATH in the coming months, possibly leading to a revival of the NFT sector in the months following.</p>
										<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">

												<span class="image fit">

											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>It's worth noting the weeks surrounding the 2024 US presidential election: Following the week of November 4, both DEX weekly volume and NFT marketplace volume saw a significant bump up, and thus the macro trend shift to the upside was confirmed.</p>
									<p>It's also worth noting that while weekly DEX volume is steadily going up, weekly NFT marketplace volume experienced a blow-off top following the election result, lending credence to the idea that NFT market trends are offset by DEX trends by roughly a few months (with NFT relevancy lagging behind the rest of the crypto market).</p>
									<h2>signs of sector relevancy</h2>
										<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">
												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart9.png" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>To gauge NFT relevancy, we can use monthly NFT marketplace volume proportional to monthly DEX exchange volume as a percent. In January 2022, NFT volume peaked at 7.8% of total volume. Today, it stands at 0.2%. It's worth noting that NFT proportional volume doesn't reach firmly above 1% total volume except for the 2021-2022 boom. When it does, we may start to see relevancy for the sector again.</p>
										<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">
												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart10.png" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>Within the NFT ecosystem itself, there were four notable collections that showed continued strength despite poor market conditions through sustained high volume. These collections were:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Bored Ape Yacht Club</li>
										<li>Mutant Ape Yacht Club</li>
										<li>Pudgy Penguins</li>
										<li>Azuki</li>
									</ol>
									<p> </p>
									<p>Should there be a sector-wide revival, these collections may show to be among the top winners.</p>
									<h2>market maturity</h2>
										<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12">
												<span class="image fit">

												<span class="image fit">
													<img src="images/Chart12.png" alt="" />
												</span>
											</div>
										</div>
										</div>
									<p>As the data currently stands, nearly half (48.3%) of wallets holding an NFT hold just one, showing signs of market immaturity and massive growth potential for the sector, should the narrative play out as expected.</p>
